# My-Mobapp-Studio

# Description

Welcome!

We are delighted to hire you as **Junior Data Scientist** here at **My MobApp Studio**. As I told you during your very first interview, data science is very new for us but you succeeded in convincing us that it's one of the key factors to be successful in our digital world, as you said: data is life.

Last management meeting, we decided we would allocate resource to create a new mobile app and I have to say that I have already received multiple emails showing the enthusiasm from our employees who wants to be part of the team.
We have all in-house the different skills we need to make this project a success (marketing, design, game design, software engineer)

Before moving forward, I will need a report on the market. In order to complete our portfolio, this new App will be first published on the Google Play Store so that you can focus your research on it.

I will just shoot some questions here:

What is the size of the market? numbers of downloads and $
Same question but per category? (percentages please)
Depending on each category, what is the ratio of downloads per app?
Any other information you will find useful for us to make the right decision would be great.
I remember you told me you are also a developer, I'm myself an old developer, so I'm thinking maybe if you can build some code it would be great and display your results on the terminal.

I will invite my VP marketing and VP designer to the meeting, formatting will be a real plus, and if they have additional questions be ready to jump back in the code.

Best,
John
